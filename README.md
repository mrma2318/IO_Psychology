# IO_Psychology
### The purpose of this repository is to provide insight into my background and relevent projects to show my skills and abilities. 

## Background
- Data is being collected everyday, all around us. What we decide to do with that data though can lead to future development among people and organizations. To assist myself in better understanding data and data visualizations, I took it upon myself to take a data analytics bootcamp through Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Relevant topics I learned during this class include Python, JavaScript, VS Code, SQL, Statistics and R, Tableau, and Web Scraping. 

- I currently have my Master's in Industrial and Organizational (IO) Psychology, where I already have a background in R. However, understanding these additional systems can assist me in better cleaning, reading, and understanding data before I even start running analysis. It also provides me additional ways in how to create visualizations as well, such as using Tableau for quick visualizations. Being an IO Psychologist, you learn multiple concepts including understanding human behavior and performance in the workplace and how to improve an organization. 

- In the next section, I will provide some background on projects I've done that showcase some of these concepts. If you would like to view additional projects I've conducted, you can visit my [Git Hub Page](https://github.com/mrma2318?tab=repositories) for additional projects.

### Job Analysis
- One important skill to understand how to do, is conduct a job analysis. A job analysis is the process of learning and understanding what knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) that are necessary to perform a job effectively. It helps the employer in recruitment and selection, and performance management, while also assisting the potential employee with a clear picture of what is required of them. Conducting a job analysis, helps in making sure we are choosing the best fit candidate for a position. 

- In addition, positions are continously changing as well as expectations for potential employees. Therefore, understanding how to review roles and job expectations by performing a job analysis you can assist in creating new standards for that position and update performance processes. In 2019, I created a job analysis and job performance measure for a University in Midwest Missouri for their HR department. The formal report can be viewed by visiting the [Performance Management for HR](https://github.com/mrma2318/IO_Psychology/blob/7e8c592de4022012f7e96587cc05340db0953fd9/Performance_Management_for_HR.docx) document. 

### Psychometrics
- As previously mentioned, when working with data, it's important to understand how to interpret that data so you can run analysis on it. Being able to look at a dataset and understand what you are looking at is important, but you also need to understand additional concepts beyond just the numbers. For example, how the data was collected, cleaning data, running factor analysis to determine which items best fit the measure, determine reliability and validity.

- Previously I created a Test Manual going through the process of developing and maintaining valid and reliable measures of growth mindset to assist in determining whether the participant expressed a growth mindset and if they believed their leaders to express one as well. For this project, I had to research previous growth mindset studies and measures to assist in creating my own. Once I created my measure, I had subject matter experts review my items. After examining their ratings, created cut off scores, and discarded items, I could then collect the data. When I was finished collecting data, I could then clean the data and run an exploratory factor analysis to determine which items were the best fit for my measure. 

- Then I needed to conduct analysis for the reliability and validity on my items to further determine which items to keep and which to discard before I could run a multiple linear regression on the data. To see the entire manual, you can visit the [Test Manual](https://github.com/mrma2318/IO_Psychology/blob/272568bdf16bea000fe956cd383c8980d8809331/Test_Manual.docx) report. 

## Data Analytics and Visualizations
- As technology continues to improve, so does how we need to view or interpret things. I took this data analytics bootcamp at Washington University to further improve my ability to interpret data and create visualizations beyond R. While I have enjoyed every project I've worked on in this class, two of my favorite projects I've worked on, is I created an HTML project and Tableau visualizations. 

### HTML Project
- For the HTML project, we worked with the belly button biodiversity data where I idenitified the top 10 bacterial species in volunteers belly buttons. If a species was identified to manufacturing synthetic beef, then I will be able to identify whether that same species is found in the volunteers naval. I needed to create an [index.html](https://github.com/mrma2318/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/blob/3d91ed67ea24dd31e828c8a8819e0d0470ed2149/index.html) to put my code in for to webpage and to also create visualizations for each specific test subject. To express the data, I created three types of visiualizations, a bar chart, bubble chart, and a guage. You can visit the [Belly Button Biodiversity](https://mrma2318.github.io/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/) webpage to look at the different subjects and outputs of each subject. 

### Tableau Project
- Tableau was a great source to use in order to generate quick visualizations from a dataset. For this project I used Citi Bike's dataset. However, you need to know what questions you want to ask so you know which variables to put for your x and y axis for the visualizations. For example, I wanted to get a breakdown of gender to better understand more information about the customers. From the image below, you can see that about 65% of the customers from this dataset were male. 

- Being able to utilize Tableau can be a great skill in providing quick visualizations and results for a dataset to see progress. For example, when looking at the Citi Bike dataset, I looked at the peak hours for the month of August when people are riding bikes, as well as the top starting location. If this data was in the beginning process of collecting data, this provides great visualization of where the data is currently. Thus, as data continues to be collected, the visualzations could show a change in peak riding hours as well as top starting locations for the month of August. It could also show us the differences between each month as temperatures begin to change and the number of riders might change as well.
